# CueBooth — Project Design Document

**Project Name:** CueBooth
**Version:** 0.1 — Initial Planning
**Date:** May 17, 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

CueBooth is a system to automate and simplify the operation of a church worship service that is both in-person and live-streamed. The current setup involves manual coordination of a PTZ camera, digital soundboard (Behringer XR18), OBS Studio, PowerPoint slides, Bitfocus Companion, and multiple streaming platforms via Restream — all requiring significant expertise from the operator.

CueBooth replaces this multi-tool workflow with a unified system consisting of:

- A **server application** running on the sanctuary PC that directly controls all hardware and software.
- A **cross-platform client application** (tablet, phone, desktop, web) providing a single control surface.
- **Slide-driven automation** that derives A/V and scene state from PowerPoint slide metadata.
- **Audio automation** including feedback detection, auto-leveling, and profile switching.

The goal is to reduce operator complexity such that a non-technical person can run a basic service using only a slide clicker, while still allowing experienced operators full manual control.

### 2.5 Companion Button Groups (from config analysis)

Based on the attached Companion configuration, the primary control surfaces include:
- **Audio mute/unmute toggles** — per-mic and per-group (choir, non-choir)
- **Camera presets** — named positions (Piano, Choir, Podium, Altar Table Wide, Sanctuary Wide, etc.)
- **Combined camera+audio presets** — e.g., "Choir View" sets camera position AND mutes non-choir/unmutes choir
- **OBS scene switching**
- **PowerPoint slide control** (forward/back)
- **Stream start/stop**
- **Recording start/stop**

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

The CueBooth server is an **orchestration and automation layer** that delegates to Bitfocus Companion for most hardware control. Companion's plugin ecosystem already handles VISCA, OSC, OBS WebSocket, and dozens of other protocols — reimplementing those would be wasted effort. The server only goes direct to hardware where Companion is inadequate: real-time audio meters, velocity-based PTZ, and OBS video relay.

### 3.2 Integration Boundaries

The key design principle is: **delegate to Companion unless there's a specific reason not to.**

| Operation | Path | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Camera presets (recall named positions) | Server → Companion HTTP → VISCA plugin → Camera | Companion already stores presets and handles the protocol |
| Camera PTZ joystick (velocity-based) | Server → VISCA direct → Camera | Companion's hold-a-button PTZ is clunky; VISCA velocity commands need continuous control |
| OBS scene switching | Server → Companion HTTP → OBS plugin → OBS | Companion already has the scene names and macros |
| Stream/recording start/stop | Server → Companion HTTP → OBS plugin → OBS | Same as above |
| Audio mute toggles (discrete) | Server → Companion HTTP → OSC plugin → XR18 | Simple on/off, Companion handles it |
| Audio faders (continuous) | Server → OSC direct → XR18 | UDP is much more responsive than HTTP round-trips for fader drag gestures |
| Audio meters (real-time) | Server ← OSC direct ← XR18 | Companion doesn't expose meter data; XR18 streams it via OSC subscription |
| Audio gain/EQ/profiles | Server → OSC direct → XR18 | Already connected for meters; direct OSC gives full parameter access |
| Audio automation (feedback, leveling) | Server → OSC direct → XR18 | Needs raw meter data + fast response |
| OBS video preview relay | Server → OBS WebSocket direct → OBS | Companion doesn't expose screenshot/video capture |
| Combined macros (camera+audio+scene) | Server → Companion HTTP (single trigger) | Companion already has combined presets wired up |
| Slide-driven actions | Slide Engine → routes to Companion HTTP or direct as appropriate | Automation layer orchestrates both paths |

### 3.3 Component Breakdown

#### CueBooth Server (Go)

The orchestration and automation daemon running on the sanctuary PC. It does NOT reimplement protocol-level control for most hardware — it delegates to Companion for that. Its primary roles are:

- **Automation:** Execute slide-driven rules, audio automation, pre/post-service sequences.
- **Orchestration:** Coordinate actions across Companion, direct OSC, and direct VISCA into unified workflows.
- **Client API:** Serve a WebSocket API that the Flutter client connects to, providing a single control surface.
- **Direct hardware (where needed):** OSC for audio meters/faders/automation, VISCA for joystick PTZ, OBS WebSocket for video relay.

**Why Go:**
- Compiled, single binary deployment — no runtime to install or manage.
- Excellent concurrency model (goroutines) — ideal for managing simultaneous connections (Companion HTTP, OSC UDP, VISCA TCP, OBS WebSocket, client WebSocket, HID).
- Strong networking stdlib — HTTP client (for Companion API), WebSocket, UDP (for OSC).
- Mature OSC libraries (`hypebeast/go-osc` or `scgolern/osc`).
- Can run as a Windows service via `golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc` or wrapped with NSSM.
- Cross-compiles trivially if you ever move the server to Linux.
- Pragmatic and fast to develop in given your background.

**Go vs alternatives considered:**
- **Rust:** More powerful type system but steeper learning curve. The async model adds complexity. The server isn't performance-critical — it's I/O bound to network devices.
- **C#/.NET:** Natural for Windows services and COM interop. Heavier deployment. The COM advantage is handled by the sidecar.
- **Node/Deno:** Interpreted, larger footprint. Not your preference.
- **C++:** You know it well, but development velocity for network services is much lower.

#### Companion Integration Layer

The server talks to Companion via its HTTP API (`http://localhost:8000`). Key operations:
- **Button press:** Trigger any configured Companion button (which may execute multi-action macros — camera preset + mute changes + scene switch in one call).
- **Button state:** Read the current state of toggle buttons (mute on/off, scene active).
- **Variable read/write:** Access Companion variables for dynamic state.

This means the existing Companion configuration continues to work and evolve independently. New plugins can be added to Companion without any changes to the CueBooth server. The server simply needs to know which Companion button IDs map to which logical actions — this is stored in the CueBooth config file.

#### PowerPoint Monitor (C# Sidecar)

A small, focused process (~200 lines) that handles PowerPoint COM automation:
- Connects to PowerPoint via COM to detect slide changes — events in the target
  design; CB-006 ships an initial polling implementation.
  *(Phasing: polling is simpler and dependency-free, with no STA-thread/message-
  pump machinery; CB-040 supersedes it with the event-based design to cut latency
  and idle CPU. Polling vs. events is a latency/efficiency choice — the
  slide-change payload and the IPC contract are identical either way.)*
- Reads slide metadata/notes (where CueBooth rules are defined).
- Forwards events to the Go server over a local named pipe or localhost WebSocket.
  The pipe payload contract (distinct from the client↔server WebSocket protocol
  in [protocol.md](protocol.md)) is formalized in CB-041.
- If PowerPoint is ever replaced, only this sidecar changes.

C# is used because COM interop in Go is painful, and .NET is already on every Windows machine.

#### HID Input Handler

Captures raw HID events from the Norwii N29 clicker. This replaces:
- The Norwii remapping software (which resets unpredictably).
- The AutoHotkey script.

The Go server reads the USB HID device directly, interprets button presses (short, long, double), and routes them to configurable actions. This makes the clicker fully programmable and reliable.

#### Audio Engine (Direct OSC)

Communicates with the XR18 via OSC over UDP. This bypasses Companion because:
- Companion doesn't expose real-time meter data.
- Continuous fader control needs UDP's low latency, not HTTP round-trips.
- Audio automation requires raw meter access and fast response times.

Capabilities:
- Subscribe to and stream real-time audio meters to the client.
- Read/write fader levels, gain, EQ, bus sends with low latency.
- Implement automation: feedback detection, auto-leveling (target LUFS), speech activity detection for auto-mute.
- Store and recall channel profiles (e.g., "Pastor EQ" vs "Guest Pastor EQ").

Note: simple mute toggles can go through either Companion or direct OSC. Since the OSC connection exists anyway, mute commands from the client fader UI go direct. Companion's mute buttons continue to work independently — the XR18 handles concurrent OSC clients.

#### Camera Joystick (Direct VISCA)

VISCA over IP to the AV-1281G, used ONLY for velocity-based PTZ control. Companion continues to handle camera preset recall.

The VISCA `Pan-TiltDrive` command accepts pan speed (0x01–0x18) and tilt speed (0x01–0x11) parameters. The Flutter client presents a virtual joystick where displacement from center maps to velocity. Releasing the joystick sends a stop command. Zoom works the same way with a vertical slider mapping to zoom speed.

This gives smooth, proportional camera control that Companion's "hold a button for a fixed time" approach can't match.

#### Video Relay (Direct OBS WebSocket)

Delivers OBS program and preview feeds to connected clients. Companion doesn't expose this capability.

- **Phase 1:** Periodic JPEG snapshots via OBS WebSocket `GetSourceScreenshot`. Low bandwidth, ~2-5 fps. Good enough for monitoring.
- **Phase 2:** SRT/RTMP output from OBS → Go server → WebRTC to clients. Near real-time preview.

#### Slide Engine

The automation brain. When a slide change is detected:
1. Receive slide change event + metadata from the C# sidecar.
2. Parse the rule definitions from the slide's notes.
3. Determine which actions to execute immediately vs. hold as the pending set for operator confirmation.
4. Route immediate actions to the appropriate path (Companion HTTP for presets/scenes, direct OSC for audio, etc.).
5. Hold the deferred actions as the slide's pending set (replacing any prior un-confirmed pending) and signal the client (and/or clicker).

### 3.4 Slide Rule Format

Rules are embedded in PowerPoint slide notes. Format is a simple DSL. Rules reference **logical preset names** defined in the server config, which map to Companion button IDs and/or direct OSC commands.

```
@cuebooth
camera.main: choir
scene: camera-with-slides
audio.mute: non-choir
audio.unmute: choir
apply: immediate
```

```
@cuebooth
camera.main: podium-with-slides
scene: camera-with-slides
audio.mute: choir
audio.unmute: podium, presenter
apply: on-confirm
```

The server config maps these names to actual actions:

```toml
# cuebooth.toml (excerpt)
[presets.camera.main.choir]      # camera presets are namespaced by camera id
companion_button = "1/0/2"     # page/row/column in Companion

[presets.scene.camera-with-slides]
companion_button = "1/3/1"
# Actual OBS scene: "Scripture/Announcements"

[presets.audio.mute.non-choir]
companion_button = "1/1/0"     # OR direct OSC:
# osc_command = "/ch/01/mix/on"
# osc_value = 0
```

- `apply: immediate` (the default when `apply` is omitted) — actions execute as soon as the slide changes.
- `apply: on-confirm` — actions become the slide's pending set until the operator presses the confirm button on the clicker; advancing to another slide replaces the pending set without applying it.
- Repeated `audio.mute`/`audio.unmute` lines accumulate: their targets union together, equivalent to a single comma-separated line.
- Keys are case-insensitive; preset-name values are case-sensitive. The block begins at the `@cuebooth` line and ends at the next blank line or the end of the notes; surrounding note text is ignored.
- Validation is non-fatal per action: if a rule references a preset name not in the config, the server logs a warning, skips just that action, and still fires the rest (the operator sees the warning in the client), so a single typo never breaks the whole transition. This is deliberately softer than interactive `/ws` commands, which reject an unknown preset outright with an `unknown_preset` nak (see [`protocol.md`](protocol.md) §8) — a slide rule fires automatically mid-event with no prompt to correct, so skip-and-continue beats failing the transition.
- Slide authors use friendly preset names; the server config handles the routing details.
- A service-level config file defines defaults, preset mappings, and override behavior.

### 3.5 Client Application (Flutter)

A single app that consolidates:
- The Companion button grid, rendered natively from Companion's own Satellite surface (see §3.6.1): every button — camera presets, mute toggles, scene switches, page navigation, live feedback — is whatever Companion is configured with, auto-discovered with nothing defined client-side.
- OBS program/preview video.
- Audio meters and fader controls for selected channels.
- Stream chat (embedded Restream chat or direct API).
- Slide status indicator (current slide, upcoming automation, confirm button).
- Stream status (live/offline, viewer count, recording status).
- Quick-access channel profiles (EQ presets per mic).

**Platform targets:** iPad (primary), iPhone, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, Web (fallback).

**Framework:** Flutter (Dart). Compiles to native binaries on all targets — no bridge, no JS runtime. Desktop support (Windows, macOS, Linux) is first-party and stable. Web output uses WASM/Canvas (heavier than typical web apps, but fine for a control surface — not a public site). The widget composition model and reactive state management map well to a real-time control surface with meters, faders, and live video.

### 3.6 Communication Protocol

Client ↔ Server communication is over WebSocket with JSON messages. The server is authoritative — clients send commands, server broadcasts state updates. The normative wire format — every message type, field, the per-target actions catalog, and the meter channel — is specified in [`protocol.md`](protocol.md); the example below is an abbreviated illustration and follows the v1 shapes defined there.

```jsonc
// Client → Server: command
{ "type": "cmd", "target": "camera", "action": "preset", "value": "choir" }

// Server → Client: state update (abbreviated — see protocol.md for the full shape)
{
  "type": "state",
  "rev": 142,
  "audio": {
    "channels": {
      "presenter-lapel": { "mute": false, "level_db": -6.2, "gain_db": 32.0 },
      "podium": { "mute": true, "level_db": -8.0, "gain_db": 28.0 }
    }
  },
  "camera": { "main": { "preset": "choir", "pan": -0.25, "tilt": 0.10, "zoom": 0.40 } },
  "obs": { "scene": "camera-with-slides", "streaming": true, "recording": true, "uptime_seconds": 2535 },
  "slides": { "current": 5, "total": 24, "pending_actions": [] },
  "stream": { "platform": "restream", "viewers": 12 }
}
```

Audio meters are sent at a higher frequency (~10 Hz, configurable) on a separate WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/meters`) to avoid flooding the main state channel; see [`protocol.md`](protocol.md) §6 (*Meter channel*).

#### 3.6.1 Companion button surface

The operator's button grid is **not** re-implemented in the client. Instead the server registers itself with Bitfocus Companion's **Satellite API** as a remote surface — the same protocol a Stream Deck Satellite or Companion's web emulator uses — over TCP (Companion's default port 16622). Companion renders each configured button to a bitmap and streams it to the server; the server forwards those bitmaps to clients over the main `/ws` channel as `surface-key` frames, and the client renders them natively in a grid and sends taps back as `surface-press` frames, which the server relays to Companion as key presses.

This means the button grid is exactly whatever Companion is configured with — labels, icons, colors, page navigation, and live feedback are all rendered by Companion — with **nothing defined or maintained client-side and no way for the grid to drift out of sync** with the Companion configuration. It directly realizes the original intent (running the Companion emulator alongside the operator) while keeping everything in one native app, leaving room for the higher-value native controls Companion handles poorly (velocity PTZ joystick, faders) to sit alongside the grid. The surface frames are specified in [`protocol.md`](protocol.md) §10; they deliberately bypass the revisioned `state`/`state-delta` machinery because button bitmaps are large and change often (clocks, feedback).

The default surface is a Stream Deck XL layout (8 columns × 4 rows, 72px bitmaps), matching the operator's primary Companion page; it is configurable per deployment and disabled when no satellite endpoint is set. The server connects over TCP (16622); Companion 3.5+ also offers the same protocol over WebSocket (16623), and the transport is isolated so it can move there later if it proves advantageous.

### 3.7 Remote Access

The server binds to `0.0.0.0` (or a configurable interface). For remote access:
- On the local network: direct connection.
- Remotely: via Tailscale (already in use). The Flutter app connects to the server's Tailscale IP. No additional VPN or tunneling infrastructure needed.

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & Documentation (This Session)
- [x] Document current system and manual procedures.
- [x] Finalize architecture design (this document).
- [ ] Create GitHub repo and project board.
- [ ] Set up initial project structure (Go server, Flutter client, C# sidecar).

### Phase 1: Server Core + Companion Integration
**Goal:** Prove out the server architecture by wrapping Companion's HTTP API. Get the Flutter client talking to the server and controlling things through Companion.

- Set up Go project, build system, Windows service scaffolding.
- Implement Companion HTTP API client (button press, button state, variables).
- Server configuration file mapping logical actions to Companion button IDs.
- WebSocket API server: client connections, command routing, state broadcast.
- Minimal Flutter client: connect to server, trigger Companion buttons for scene switching, stream start/stop, camera presets.

**Milestone:** Can control existing Companion buttons from the Flutter app, routed through the server. Everything Companion does today is accessible from the new client.

### Phase 2: Audio Control (Direct OSC)
**Goal:** Direct XR18 control for meters, faders, and profiles. This is the biggest improvement over the current iPad workflow.

- Implement OSC client for XR18 in Go.
- Subscribe to and stream real-time audio meters to clients.
- Read/write fader levels, gain with low-latency OSC.
- DCA group control.
- Channel profile storage/recall (EQ presets for pastor vs guest).
- Configurable channel visibility (hide unused channels in client).
- Client UI: fader strips for selected channels, meters, mute buttons, gain knobs, profile selector.

**Milestone:** Audio mixing from the Flutter app with live meters. X-Air app no longer needed during service.

### Phase 3: Camera Joystick (Direct VISCA)
**Goal:** Smooth, velocity-based PTZ control. Camera presets continue to go through Companion.

- Implement VISCA over IP client in Go (velocity PTZ commands only — `Pan-TiltDrive`, `Zoom` with speed parameters).
- Map joystick displacement → velocity → VISCA speed parameters.
- Stop command on joystick release.
- Client UI: virtual joystick (touch-based, drag from center), zoom slider.
- Multi-camera support: address second camera when installed.

**Milestone:** Smooth proportional camera control from the client. Camera presets still work via Companion buttons.

### Phase 4: Slide Engine
**Goal:** Slide-driven automation of camera, audio, and OBS scenes.

- Build C# sidecar for PowerPoint COM event monitoring.
- Define and implement the slide rule DSL.
- Server-side rule parser and action executor.
- Immediate vs. deferred action system.
- Actions route to Companion HTTP (for presets/scenes) or direct OSC (for audio) as appropriate.
- Client UI: current slide indicator, pending actions display, confirm/cancel controls.
- Service configuration file format (mapping preset names to Companion buttons and OSC paths).

**Milestone:** Advancing slides automatically triggers correct camera, audio, and OBS state. Operator can override. "Clicker-only" basic mode works for simple services.

### Phase 5: HID Input & Clicker Independence
**Goal:** Eliminate Norwii software and AutoHotkey. Full clicker programmability.

- Raw USB HID capture in Go for the Norwii N29 dongle.
- Map all physical buttons (short press, long press, double press) to configurable actions.
- Default mapping: forward = next slide, back = prev slide, long-press forward = confirm pending actions, long-press back = cancel pending actions.
- Optional: other buttons for quick mute toggle, camera preset cycle.

**Milestone:** Norwii app and AutoHotkey uninstalled. Clicker works reliably with no external dependencies.

### Phase 6: Video Preview Relay
**Goal:** OBS program and preview video visible in the client, eliminating Zoom.

- Phase 6a: OBS WebSocket screenshot-based preview (~2-5 fps). Minimal effort, sufficient for monitoring.
- Phase 6b: SRT/RTMP output from OBS → Go server → WebRTC to clients. Real-time preview with low latency.

**Milestone:** Zoom is no longer needed. Operator sees exactly what viewers see, directly in the app.

### Phase 7: Audio Automation
**Goal:** Intelligent audio management reducing operator burden.

- Feedback detection: monitor XR18 meter data for sustained narrow-band peaks, auto-mute or notch-filter the offending channel.
- Auto-leveling for stream: target LUFS measurement, adjust USB bus output to maintain consistent stream volume.
- Auto-mute/unmute: detect speech activity on mics, auto-mute silent mics to reduce noise floor.
- In-house auto-leveling: requires ambient level measurement (external mic or dedicated measurement mic). Stretch goal — may need additional hardware (SPL sensor or reference mic).

**Milestone:** Stream audio levels are consistent without manual adjustment. Feedback events are caught and suppressed automatically.

### Phase 8: Setup Automation & Polish
**Goal:** Automate pre-service and post-service routines.

- Smart power control: network-controllable power strips/switches for speakers, mic receivers, camera (investigate options — Kasa/Tapo smart plugs, networked PDUs).
- Pre-service sequence: single button to power on all equipment, launch OBS, open slides, set Beginning scene, start countdown. Executed via a mix of Companion buttons and direct commands.
- Post-service sequence: stop stream/recording, mute all, power off camera, update Restream date, shut down.
- Opening slide/announcement image auto-extraction from PowerPoint (replace the manual Paint workflow).
- YouTube pre-roll video: auto-detect video link from slide, calculate start time, manage playback and transition.
- Google Drive reliability: auto-detect broken state, kill/restart, or switch to OneDrive/direct sync alternative.

**Milestone:** A single button starts the entire pre-service sequence. Post-service teardown is equally automated.

## 6. Story Breakdown (GitHub Issues)

Below is a suggested set of GitHub issues organized by phase. Each is scoped to be independently completable. Labels: `server`, `client`, `sidecar`, `docs`, `infra`.

### Phase 0 — Foundation
- **CB-001** `docs` — Write operational runbook for manual worship service operation
- **CB-002** `docs` — Finalize project design document
- **CB-003** `infra` — Create GitHub repo, project board, and CI scaffolding

## 7. Open Questions & Risks

1. **Projector automation:** You noted this likely can't be automated. Confirm whether the projector supports RS-232, IP control, or CEC over HDMI. Many projectors do — this might be solvable.

2. **XR18 OSC concurrency:** The XR18 supports a limited number of simultaneous OSC clients (typically 4). The Go server's direct OSC connection counts as one. X-Air Edit on the iPad (if still used during transition) counts as another. Companion's OSC plugin counts as a third. Should stay within limits, but monitor this. Once the Flutter app replaces X-Air Edit, that frees a slot.

3. **HID device access on Windows:** Raw HID access may require running the server as administrator or using a filter driver (e.g., HidGuard) to prevent Windows from also processing the HID events. Needs investigation in Phase 5.

4. **WebRTC complexity (Phase 6b):** WebRTC in Go is possible (via Pion) but non-trivial. Phase 6a (screenshots) may be sufficient for a long time. Don't let Phase 6b block other work.

5. **Feedback detection accuracy (Phase 7):** Purely meter-based feedback detection has limits. May need FFT analysis of the audio stream (the USB output) rather than just meter levels. Evaluate whether the XR18's meter data is granular enough.

6. **Second camera:** When the backup AV-1281G is installed, the server needs to manage two VISCA connections for joystick control, and Companion needs a second set of presets. The slide rule DSL needs a `camera-id` field.

7. **Companion API stability:** The CueBooth server depends on Companion's HTTP API. Companion v3 changed some API patterns from v2. Pin the Companion version and test API compatibility before upgrading Companion. Companion's API is documented but not versioned with stability guarantees.

8. **Companion button ID mapping maintenance:** The CueBooth config maps logical action names to Companion button IDs. If someone reorganizes the Companion layout, the mapping breaks. Consider using Companion variables or named triggers (available in Companion 3.x) instead of raw button coordinates where possible.
